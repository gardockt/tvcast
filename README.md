Cast YouTube videos to TV

## About

The main goal of this application is to provide option for casting YouTube videos to TV app without the use of the official mobile app, or - in particular - using unofficial YouTube apps that don't support casting.

## Usage

After launching the app, enter video ID or URL into the input box - YouTube and Invidious URLs are officially supported, but other frontends are likely to work as well. Then select the target device from the list below the input box. Keep in mind that both devices have to be connected to the same network.

Alternatively, the app can be accessed via Share menu when sharing video URL.
